# Asset Classes
LSR features 6 distinct asset class categories, and each plays a critical role in establishing the tokenomics balance within the game and within the greater Treasure ecosystem. These asset pillars are represented on-chain and in-game.

## Value Tokens
-   _Primary Issuance_: $Busho is earned daily via a boosted veSamuRise score for every SamuRise token you have minted on L2 Arbirtrum. $Magic was converted from $Eth earned in the initial mint and immediately deposited to a multi-sig wallet for the Guild Treasury.
-   _Yield logic_: 
			- 10 $Busho is yielded per day for each SamuRise minted on L2
			- $Magic is yielded for all Staked SamuRise on L1 and is proportional to the percentage of the collection you own
-   _Utility_: Used to pay for core SamuRise actions on Homeland

## SamuRise Tokens
-   _Primary Issuance_: Minted/purchased on Ethereum L1 and then performed the "Escape the Bogai" quest to mint on L2 for access to gameplay
-   _Utility_: Used to perform core SamuRise actions on Homeland and the main form of governance in the LSR metaverse

## Worker Tokens
-   _Primary Issuance_: Collections staked (locked) on Ethereum L1 and minted as a new erc-1155 collection on L2
-   _Utility_: Used to substitute SamuRise by putting these workers to use on the Land with Farm and Produce actions to scale your #Gohan and #materials yields

## Tengoku Estates
-   _Primary Issuance:_  Claim from snapshot on L2 and future mints
-   _Utility_: Required for all production actions (farm #Gohan, train #Chikara, produce #materials) once it has completed the "Sanctuary Quest" and becomes your Zaisan for a chosen Faction

## Resources
-   _Primary Issuance_: Various yield types from working SamuRise on Homeland
-   _Yield logic_: Yield rates are relative to level of your production facility (farm, dojo, and mine)
-   _Utility_: Necessary to train your SamuRise and Dojo, feed your armies, and acquire the materials to purify the Land by building iconic monuments within each Province (Theatre, Castle, Temple)

## Items
-   _Primary Issuance_: Earned via questing, Factional performance, crafting or community accomplishments
-   _Utility_: Rare items increase value of Land (totems) and PFP (equippables), and consumables are used for temporary game buffs
