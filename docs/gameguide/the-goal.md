# Introduction

The Lost SamuRise is a faction based strategy game played in the fictional world of **Tengoku** (*'Heaven'*) that borrows lore and stylistic elements from Samurai bushido culture in classical Japan. Our GameFi protocol is designed to be interoperable across the entire Ethereum-L2 ecosystem, but we have chosen to enter Arbitrum and join Treasure’s emerging metaverse as part of our initial phase of delivery.

SamuRise builds upon the existing P2E concepts by innovating further into the design elements of inter-factional board game like mechanics to amplify social coordination, risk based decision trade-offs applied to asset scarcity, and providing utility to abandoned NFT collections looking for a lifeline.


# The Goal

As warlords in Tengoku, you recently escaped from the Rift (*'Bogai'*) into a desecrated land that has been abandoned by the Gods for millennia. Three genesis Factions have organized across the collection of SamuRise to engage in the resource war that will keep Tengoku on the brink of annihilation for many years to come. The most successful Faction will earn the right to become the Shogunate, and the most powerful SamuRise will ascent to become Shoguns and celebrated for generations as legends of the land.

To succeed, a player will be required to work the land for valuable and scarce resources. These resources are used to train in the way of Bushido, support your Faction armies and their strategic ambitions, and finally, to develop your realm by building castles, temples, and theaters. The Shogunate will be awarded to the Faction that demonstrates guile, creativity and boldness for each game Year. The end-game for the 1st season is to build all 3 iconic building types on each of the 3 provinces belonging to a Faction (for a total of 9). Only in this manner will you purify the land for your people, and reverse the decay and rot emanating from the Rift that has poisoned Tengoku for millennia.

# Preparation

## Geography
The land of Tengoku is far more extensive than the rice paper sketch scribes have managed to capture thus far. What we know is that the contested part is divided into 9 Provinces around the Emperor's home of Kyoto. Three Provinces are in control of each Faction. (see Map legend for details)

**Land Logic**
Each Province is in turn divided by Land assets, up to a maximum of 1111, or 3333 per Faction. Only 1 Land can be productive per Ethereum wallet address, as long as they successfully completed the "Sanctuary Quest", which permanently assigns that Land parcel to a Faction. This Land becomes your Homeland ('*Zaisan*').
**Provincial Borders**
The borders between provinces will play a more important role during the Faction phase of the game. Direct military conflict in the form of an 'Attack' Order can only be executed across a border between warring Factions. The map above is organized for balanced gameplay and each Faction has an equal number of connections to enemy Factions.

## Asset Classes
LSR features 6 distinct asset class categories, and each plays a critical role in establishing the tokenomics balance within the game and within the greater Treasure ecosystem. These asset pillars are represented on-chain and in-game.

**Value Tokens**
-   _Primary Issuance_: $Busho is earned daily via a boosted veSamuRise score for every SamuRise token you have minted on L2 Arbirtrum. $Magic was converted from $Eth earned in the initial mint and immediately deposited to a multi-sig wallet for the Guild Treasury.
-   _Yield logic_: 
			- 10 $Busho is yielded per day for each SamuRise minted on L2
			- $Magic is yielded for all Staked SamuRise on L1 and is proportional to the percentage of the collection you own
-   _Utility_: Used to pay for core SamuRise actions on Homeland

**SamuRise Tokens**
-   _Primary Issuance_: Minted/purchased on Ethereum L1 and then performed the "Escape the Bogai" quest to mint on L2 for access to gameplay
-   _Utility_: Used to perform core SamuRise actions on Homeland and the main form of governance in the LSR metaverse

**Worker Tokens**
-   _Primary Issuance_: Collections staked (locked) on Ethereum L1 and minted as a new erc-1155 collection on L2
-   _Utility_: Used to substitute SamuRise by putting these workers to use on the Land with Farm and Produce actions to scale your #Gohan and #materials yields

**Tengoku Estates**
-   _Primary Issuance:_  Claim from snapshot on L2 and future mints
-   _Utility_: Required for all production actions (farm #Gohan, train #Chikara, produce #materials) once it has completed the "Sanctuary Quest" and becomes your Zaisan for a chosen Faction

**Resources**
-   _Primary Issuance_: Various yield types from working SamuRise on Homeland
-   _Yield logic_: Yield rates are relative to level of your production facility (farm, dojo, and mine)
-   _Utility_: Necessary to train your SamuRise and Dojo, feed your armies, and acquire the materials to purify the Land by building iconic monuments within each Province (Theatre, Castle, Temple)

**Items**
-   _Primary Issuance_: Earned via questing, Factional performance, crafting or community accomplishments
-   _Utility_: Rare items increase value of Land (totems) and PFP (equippables), and consumables are used for temporary game buffs

## Season - 🟥 Worker Placement Actions
SamuRise Worker Placement Actions are the core of the game. Resources required to purify Tengoku can only be gathered by putting your SamuRise to work on the Land. There are 4 categories of resources that can be accumulated through various actions. 

All Actions are paid for in $Busho, but to increase the odds of a better outcome, $Magic can be spent as an additional and optional wager.

 1. **Training**: yields #Chikara and #Bushido cards
 2. **Farming**: yields #Gohan
 3. **Produce**: yields #materials (#Wood, #Iron, #Copper, #Silver, #Gold, Bridgeworld #treasures)
 4. **Questing**: yields #equippables, #totems, #consumables


![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samurisenft/samurise.github.io/master/static/assets/images/action_train.png)
Training your SamuRise yields the critical resource for increasing your Dojo's Level - #Chikara. An improved Dojo allows your SamuRise to level up, increasing rarity and contributes higher combat power to your Faction when fighting the enemy.

|Cost| Time|Base Yield|Bonus Yield|Die Roll
|--|--|--|--|--
| 40 $Busho|4 days|10 #Chikara|0-3 Bushido Cards|2d6
![#Chikara Production Probabilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samurisenft/samurise.github.io/master/static/assets/images/TrainTable.png)
You are always guaranteed an outcome of 40 #Chikara, but the trade-off you are allowed to consider is to try your luck for more *Bushido Cards*. If you fail to get a Card however, your Chikara production rate will increase slightly. A full set of 8 *Bushido Cards* are necessary to attract a *Sensei* to your Dojo, allowing you to build your Dojo into the Black levels.

Currently there are only two uses for #Chikara. The graphic below can be used as a reference for the *Kyu Test* and the *Build Dojo* quests

|Quest|Cost| ime|Reward|Bonus Reward|Die Roll
|--|--|--|--|--|--
|Kyu Test|100 $Chikara|4 days|Level SR|Level SR >1|1d6
The *Kyu Test* Quest is the primary method for increasing the level of your SamuRise. You have the option to *Burn* #Bushido cards to improve the probability of succeeding, and possibly gaining 2 levels.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samurisenft/samurise.github.io/master/static/assets/images/kyutest.png)

Burning additional #Bushido Cards (up to 5) improves the probability of having an extremely good training outcome and levelling up twice. This also increases the probability that you will have some of the cards returned to you. Possession of the equipped item *Golden Fude* will provide a +1 to all Die Rolls.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samurisenft/samurise.github.io/master/static/assets/images/quest_builddojo.png)
|Quest|Cost|Time|Reward
|--|--|--|--
|Build DOJO|100+ $Chikara|4 days|Level DOJO
Building your DOJO is a required upgrade for your SamuRise to increase in level, because they cannot exceed your current DOJO color. The base cost for most upgrades is 100 #Chikara, with exceptions for your first Black DOJO, and the final Shogun Level (Black-10).

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samurisenft/samurise.github.io/master/static/assets/images/builddojo.png)
Your first Black DOJO level will require that a *Sensei* is available on your Land. Burning a full set of 8x #Bushido Cards will attract a *Sensei* to your Land. Each successive Black level  requires an additional #treasure to be staked. The final 'Shogun' DOJO will necessitate 2900 #Chikara, a *Sensei* (8x #Bushido Cards), and 10 #treasures from Bridgeworld.

Progressively burning #Bushido Cards into your DOJO increases the rate of #Chikara production according to the following schedule.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samurisenft/samurise.github.io/master/static/assets/images/action_farm.png)
Farming the Land yields #Gohan. These rice stores can be bought and sold on the open marketplace, used to build up your Farm Level, or provided to your Faction to support the resource war raging across Tengoku. #Workers from Lifeboat collections can also participate in this action, allowing SamuRise to engage in more critical actions such as the Kyu Test.

|Cost| Time|Base Yield|Worker Yield|Die Roll
|--|--|--|--|--
| 40 $Busho|4 days|10 #Gohan|1 #Gohan|2d6

Producing on your Land yields resources that will be utilized by your Faction to construct the iconic monuments that will help to purify the Land. Each of the 3 monuments types, Theatre, Temple, and Castle, will have different build recipe requirements.

Training

## Season - 🟨 Council Vote
tbc
## Season - 🟩 Faction Orders
 The ruling council for each Faction has up to the end of the Season to enter their Orders through the multi-sig web interface. Earlier submission of these Orders will marginally improve the odds of success to create incentive for aggressive and highly focused social coordination among the Faction members and council.
 1. **Attack**: attack an enemy Province and loot possessions if successful
 2. **Sabotage**: undermine enemy Faction's orders, steal resources, delay purification
 3. **Build**: build one of 3 iconic monuments per Province to purify the Land
 4. **Questing**: support neighboring Province engaged in an Attack Order, or help defend
 5. **Tribute**: adjust Tribute levels for #Chikara, #Gohan and #materials

(additional details to be revealed)
## Season - 🟦 Order Resolution
Order Resolution occurs on the final hour of the Season, and all Faction orders are simultaneously and programmatically executed according to strictly implemented gaming logic.

(additional details to be revealed)
## Winter - 🔷 Resolve Revolts
Tengoku was ravaged by the Bogai, and the coming Winter will place extreme hardships on all Faction members. If you have collected enough #Gohan via tribute, you may survive. If you fall short, the people of Tengoku will rise up and revolt. The price for the Faction that falls short will be heavy.

(additional details to be revealed)
## Winter - 🔶 Emperor Awards
The Winter Season is a time to return home, recover from the long campaigns, and attend to the Emperor for awards and ceremonies.

To incorporate a significant Risk element to gameplay, Onna Mushas may choose to attend court with the Emperor. What devious plans will they hatch through whispered promises into the Emperor’s ear? Will an enemy Onna Musha succumb to the sleeved dagger or an open challenge? Are the awards given to the winning Shogunate truly safe?
