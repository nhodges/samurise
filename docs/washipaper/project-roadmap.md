# Project Roadmap

![Roadmap](/assets/images/roadmap.png)

## Phase 0: The Awakening

Mint Lost SamuRise collection

* **Mint**
  * L1
  * 5,000 free
  * 5,000 paid
  * 600 reserved for the Lost SamuRise team
* **Implement Staking functionality**  
  * Stake them on L1 and experience the Lost SamuRise metaverse on L2
* **Implement Non-Escrow Staking**
  * ERC-721 NES, or Non Escrow Staking, is a novel implementation of a staking model that does not require the owner of a token to lock it into an escrow contract.
  During the staking period, staked tokens becomes non transferrable while remaining in their owner's wallet.
  In this paradigm, the owner of a token has zero exposure to the risk of a staking contract being compromised. It is truly non-custodial in nature.

## Phase 0: Land !!

Claim Land, Sword, and other Role based NFTs

* **Claim your Land**
  * After the announced snapshot, you can claim 1 Land per wallet (erc-721) that had at least 1 SamuRise. Careful with distribution because your chance for a rare DOJO only increases with the greater number of SamuRise in that wallet.
  * A map of Tengoku is displayed to give your Land a sense of location within a Province and the Faction it belongs to
* **Claim your Sword and Discord role NFTs**
  * Grab a sword per SamuRise in your wallet, and if you have one of two rare Discord roles (Zen Master & Master Trainer), claim their NFts.
* **Implement Quests functionality**  
  * Introduce user experience and contracts for quest completion and receiving a reward. Users receives a sword and land NFT, as well as NFTs for any roles they achieved during our pre-launch marketing process.
* **Implement the “PFP Configurator” functionality**  
  * Allows a Samurai holder to alter the appearance of their PFP by equipping different items to it
  
## Phase 1: The Commitment

Introduce L2 Staking Options

* L2 Staking options are released
