# Project Roadmap

![Roadmap](/assets/images/roadmap.png)

This Roadmap reflects the current prioritization the team is pursuing in order to deliver high quality and engaging gameplay for our holders. It is meant for the purpose of transparency and may change to adjust to emergent conditions among holder feedback, tokenomics, macro conditions, development constraints, and partnerships.

**This Roadmap is a living document and will change. Our higher commitment is to deliver features and functionality with each and every seasonal game loop.**

## Prelude - phase 1

Mint Lost SamuRise collection

* **Mint**
  * L1
  * 5,000 free
  * 5,000 paid
  * 600 reserved for the Lost SamuRise team
* **Implement Staking functionality**  
  * Stake them on L1 and experience the Lost SamuRise metaverse on L2
* **Implement Non-Escrow Staking**
  * ERC-721 NES, or Non Escrow Staking, is a novel implementation of a staking model that does not require the owner of a token to lock it into an escrow contract.
  During the staking period, staked tokens becomes non transferrable while remaining in their owner's wallet.
  In this paradigm, the owner of a token has zero exposure to the risk of a staking contract being compromised. It is truly non-custodial in nature.

## Prelude - Phase 2

Claim Land, Sword, and other Role based NFTs

* **Claim your Land**
  * After the announced snapshot, you can claim 1 Land per wallet (erc-721) that had at least 1 SamuRise. Careful with distribution because your chance for a rare DOJO only increases with the greater number of SamuRise in that wallet.
  * A map of Tengoku is displayed to give your Land a sense of location within a Province and the Faction it belongs to
* **Claim your Sword and Discord role NFTs**
  * Grab a sword per SamuRise in your wallet, and if you have one of two rare Discord roles (Zen Master & Master Trainer), claim their NFts.
* **Implement Quests functionality**  
  * Introduce user experience and contracts for quest completion and receiving a reward. Users receives a sword and land NFT, as well as NFTs for any roles they achieved during our pre-launch marketing process.
* **Implement the “PFP Configurator” functionality**  
  * Allows a Samurai holder to alter the appearance of their PFP by equipping different items to it
